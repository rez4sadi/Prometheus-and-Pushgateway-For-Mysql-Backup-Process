## Prometheus-and-Pushgateway-For-Mysql-Backup-Process
n the world of systems and servers management, information monitoring is very
important. One of the popular tools for monitoring is Prometheus, which is used in
many projects due to its extensive capabilities and high flexibility. Prometheus is an
open source monitoring system and database for time-series data. This software is
designed to collect metrics from various sources such as systems, applications and
services.
Prometheus stores data or events in real time. These events can be anything related
to your application, such as memory usage, network usage, or incoming requests.
Each criterion has a name and a set of tags that can be used to filter the criteria in
the database.
Pushgateway also serves as an interface for sending temporary or processed data
that cannot be sent directly to Prometheus.
In this article, we are going to discuss how to use Pushgateway and Prometheus for
the MySQL database backup process. This process allows us to know the status of
backups and to act quickly if there is a problem.
We also use Grafana to display data and monitor systems and programs. This tool
helps us to display various data graphically for us through graphs and charts so that
we can have the necessary analysis on the data.To do this, we need to run several processes
All the codes and routines of this GitHub address are available and you can use them
First, we need to install Pushgateway, Prometheus and Grafana using Docker
at First, create a file called docker-compose.yml and put the following content in it:
```
services:
prometheus:
image: prom/prometheus
container_name: prometheus
command:
- '--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml'
ports:
- 9090:9090
restart: unless-stopped
volumes:
- ./prometheus:/etc/prometheus
- prom_data:/prometheus
networks:
- backup-process
grafana:
image: grafana/grafana
container_name: grafana
depends_on:
- prometheus
ports:
- 3000:3000
restart: unless-stopped
environment:
- GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=admin
- GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=grafana
volumes:
- ./grafana:/etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources
networks:
- backup-process
pushgateway:
image: prom/pushgateway
container_name: pushgateway
restart: unless-stopped
ports:
- "9091:9091"
networks:
- backup-process
volumes:
prom_data:
networks:
backup-process
```
and create a folder and put the following file inside it and name it prometheus.yml

```
global:
scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_timeout: 10s
evaluation_interval: 15s
alerting:
alertmanagers:
- static_configs:
- targets: []
scheme: http
timeout: 10s
api_version: v1
scrape_configs:
- job_name: prometheus
honor_timestamps: true
scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_timeout: 10s
metrics_path: /metrics
scheme: http
static_configs:
- targets:
- localhost:9090
- job_name: pushgateway
honor_timestamps: true
scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_timeout: 10s
metrics_path: /metrics
scheme: http
static_configs:
- targets:
- pushgateway:9091
```
After successfully running this project, you should be able to see the following
addresses
http://your_ip:9090
http://your_ip:9091
http://your_ip:3000
now You can run the backup file and change its parameters
After executing the backup file, if the process is executed correctly
A request is sent through the curl of a push gateway and you can view it
Using this curl,
```
echo "value 0" | curl --data-binary @- http://your_ip:9091/metrics/job/img/instance/system
```
You can see the list of your gateways with the address http://your_address:9091
Logged in to this address http://your_ip:3000 in Grafana with username and
password And in the add data source section, add prometheus to datasource and
then create a dashboard
Create a Prometheus connection through Grafana
After making sure to establish a connection with Prometheus , Create a new
dashboard from the dashboard section and follow the steps below to access this
dashboard.
And finally click the save button
You can see the dashboard output under
Conclusion
In this article, we examined how to use Prometheus and Pushgateway for the MySQL
database backup process. Using this method, we can accurately and continuously
monitor the status of our backups and take necessary actions quickly in case of any
problems. Also, using Grafana for graphical display of data makes it easier for us to
analyze and monitor system status
The use of these tools not only provides the possibility of real-time and detailed
monitoring, but also increases the assurance of the correctness of the backups and
reduces the reaction time to possible problems.
Additionally, this approach helps technical teams more effectively monitor critical
processes and better protect their data.
We hope that these tips and codes will be useful to you and that you can use them
to improve your MySQL database backup.
